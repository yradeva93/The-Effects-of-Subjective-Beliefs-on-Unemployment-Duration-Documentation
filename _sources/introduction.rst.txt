The Effects of Subjective Beliefs on Unemployment Duration project replicates the main tables and figures from an earlier project
called: The Effect of (Biased) Beliefs on Unemployment Duration. It seeks to shed light on the effect of subjective beliefs on unemployment duration,
using the IZA Survey Data :cite:`usermanual`. This is done by using The Stata Template for Reproducible Research Projects in Economics
:cite:`GaudeckerEconProjectTemplates`, ensuring replicability and allowing for the use of several programming languages
(e.g. Stata and Python).

============================

To get an idea of the overall structure of the project, please see :download:`the Directed Acyclic Graph </../../bld/src/documentation/dependency_graph.pdf>`.

Original Data
==============

The original IZA Survey Data is stored in **src/original_data/**.

Data Management
===============

In **src/data_management/** the original data is cleaned and transformed according to the needs of the later analysis.


.. _analysis:

Main Model Estimations
======================

In order to study the relationship between unemployment duration, job search intensity and subjective beliefs,
there are three dependent variables of interest, constructed from the given dataset:

* Unemployment duration
* Number of applications
* Number of search channels,

where the latter two serve as indicators for the job search intensity. 

For each dependent variable the effect of subjective beliefs is estimated in 5 specifications.
Those specifications are stored as json files in **src/model_specs/**.
For each one of the above dependent variables there is a ".do" file in **src/analysis/**,
which loops over the 5 specifications. The estimation results are stored in ".dta" files.


.. _analysis:

Classification
===============

As an additional approach a classification technique out of the context of
machine learning is employed. The respective file is also found in **src/analysis/**.
Whereas the major part of this project is written in Stata, the machine learning part is written in Python.


.. _final:

Visualisation and Results Formatting
==================================== 

The data generated through the analysis step is used for the creation of tables and figures. This is done in **src/final/**.


.. _paper:

Research Paper and Project Review
=================================
In **src/paper/** the resulting output is included in the research paper. The whole project is then analyzed in a project review.
